CQRS has three Messages:

Command
	-> action to be performed.
Events
	-> events are objects that describing something that has occured in the application. A typical source of events is the aggregate. when something important has occured within
	the aggregate, it will raise an event.
Queries

Aggregate
	An aggregate is an entity or group of entities that is always kept in a consitent state. 
	The aggregate root is the entity within the aggregate that is responsible for maintaining the consitent state.
	This makes the aggregate the primary building block for implementing a command model in CQRS based application.
